# Google Drive As File Hosting

Yet another leak from internal vietnamese modding community

This is a custom file hosting service that uses Google Drive as main file hosting, to save a lot of server costs. However, there is a risk getting quota limit or getting banned from Google

It is still being used today among the vietnamese community. https://dowsfile.com/ and https://upfile.online/dashboard/upload are using it.

Bl___mod's 2speed/uploadfree/fstore.biz is using it too but they have moved to Dropbox due to Google clousure. The upload page is closed due to legal issues
